                  If any proof was needed about Atlanta’s attraction to buyers from other states, real estate website, redfin.com noted recently that the city is perennially in their top ten list of users moving from one metro state to another. Moreover, the number of people looking to move to Atlanta increased by more than 40% year over year in late 2020. Out-of-town buyers have been a major force in Atlanta’s appreciating market as data shows that they have an average budget of 698,000, 33% higher than the local market.

                  We work hand in hand with out-of-town buyers to make their move as easy as possible, providing demographic, school, and accessibility information to help them choose their ideal location. Then we arrange virtual showings, ensuring our clients can view the home in a real-time walk-through so they can stop and ask questions just as they would if they were actually there. Once a client has settled on a property and wishes to conduct an in-person visit, we can arrange that as well, ensuring all social distancing and Covid protocols are adhered to.

The approval process is handled smoothly and efficiently with seamless digital transactions. Remote closings have also become commonplace over the last year, meaning all a buyer has to do when they next visit Atlanta, is move into their new home.</h6>
