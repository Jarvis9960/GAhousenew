                        Fixing your credit should be the first thing you think about doing after deciding that you want to buy a house. Without good or decent credit your house buying options are severely limited. Though FHA loans cater for poor credit, paying PMI and a higher interest rate are not ideal for those with financial challenges. Here are some simple steps that will take your credit score from Meh to Yeah!                      </p>

                        It sounds obvious but studying your credit report (you can get it for free every year at annualcreditreport.com) carefully will allow you to see exactly where you stand. You’ll see the things that are damaging your credit such as bankruptcies, late payments, and foreclosures.                      </p>

                        According to the credit repair company, Lexington Law, as many as 25 percent of all credit reports contain wrong information that could cause a denial on a loan application. Here are some of the things to look for:

                        <p>Correcting basic errors like the ones above can quickly boost your score and take away potential red flags from a lender. The credit bureaus are obligated legally to attempt to resolve any mistakes on their end.</p>

                        <p>
                        Any account that is past 30 days due is considered late and will result in a major ding on your credit. Try to pay these off or negotiate a pay-off settlement in return for these being removed from your credit report, known as a pay-for-delete.

                        </div>
  
                        <p>
                        It may sound counterintuitive but the more debt you can qualify for the higher your credit rating will be. The key is not to use all that debt, but rather keep it below 30%. For example, if you have a $10,000 limit credit card but only use $3000 or under, your credit score will go up because the credit agencies reward the fact that you are not maxing out all your available credit but rather being judicious.                      
                        </p>
  
                        <div>
                          <h3 className='fw-bold'>5. Pay Off Accounts Starting With The Low Balance Accounts</h3>
                        </div>
  
                        <p>Paying off low-balance accounts is easier to do than paying off high-balance ones. It will give your credit a little boost and give you a shot in the arm and the motivation to start on the larger accounts.</p>

                          <h3 className='fw-bold'>6. Open A New Credit Card Account</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                        This is another move that might have you scratching your head. Why would you apply for more debt when you are trying to pay off existing debt? For the same reason that you want to increase the limits on the cards you have. Being qualified for a higher debt amount but not using it shows fiscal responsibility on your part and thus you’ll be rewarded with the gold star of a bounce to your credit score.

                        <p>
                        This is self-explanatory. Don’t be late. Pay balances such as mortgages, credit cards, and utility bills like clockwork every month.                      </p>

                        </div>
                        <p>You can undertake most credit repair moves yourself. Many of them are common sense such as making payments on time. When it comes to continually disputing derogatory issues on your report many people lack the discipline to challenge the credit bureaus with the regularity and tenacity it takes to get them to act. That’s when outsourcing to a reputable credit repair company can come in useful. There are plenty of them about, so you’ll have to do some research on the one that best fits your needs.</p>
