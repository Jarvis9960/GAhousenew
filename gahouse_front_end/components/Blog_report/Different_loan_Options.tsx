                      Although most homeowners choose to get a conventional 30-year mortgage, that doesn’t mean that’s the right choice for you. According to the National Association of Realtors, as of 2018, the median duration US homeowners remained in their homes before selling is 13 years. So what other choices do homeowners have apart from the conventional? Quite a few, actually. Let’s take a look at the main ones.

                      <p>
                      This is the choice of most homeowners and the rates that are often touted on television and websites in news stories and ads.                       </p>

                      This is an option that is heavily touted by lenders such as Quicken Loans. There’s a lot of discussion about the usefulness of a 15-year loan.                       </p>

                          People argue that it’s better to get a 30-year mortgage and just make extra payments if you want to pay it off early. That way you have the flexibility to revert back to lesser payments if finances become tight. A 15-year mortgage, however, offers no such flexibility.

                      A VA loan is a mortgage option for people who have previously served in the military and meet the VA’s guidelines for service. If you qualify you’ll be issued with a Certificate of Eligibility to confirm you’re eligible. These loans are guaranteed by the Department of Veteran’s affairs.                       </p>

                        The big advantage is that most veterans and service members won’t need a down payment.

                         You can qualify with a lower credit score and more debt compared to conventional loans.

                        If you already have a VA Loan you can refinance up to 120% of your home’s value.
