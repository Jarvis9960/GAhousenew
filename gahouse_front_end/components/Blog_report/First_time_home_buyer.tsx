                            We love working with first-time homebuyers because it’s an opportunity not only to introduce them to their first home but also to help them turbocharge their financial future. Buying your first home is a monumental step and it’s exciting to fall in love with all the possibilities to come. Decorating, dinner parties, barbecues, and a new family. While we’re thrilled to see first-time home buyers dream, we also ask buyers to think about the day they decide to sell their home, because planning ahead and setting our clients up with the right mortgage for the right home is also a part of what we do.

                            Many homeowners plan to stay in their first home for the foreseeable future, a decade or more. If they can afford it we advise them to buy something they can grow into, perhaps with a new family or work from home jobs in mind, without feeling cramped. Whether it’s new construction or an existing home, there are plenty 3,4, and 5 bedroom homes that fit the bill.

                            Other buyers are looking for their home as a financial springboard. We might show them some fixer-uppers that they can get a 203K loan with and force appreciation by renovating and selling for a profit, or refinancing and moving on to something bigger at a later date while keeping their first home as an investment.

                            Some buyers love the idea of house-hacking, buying a duplex or triplex, and living in one of the units while others cover the mortgage. When they’ve managed to save enough money they can then look for their next home keeping their multi-unit as a cash cow.

                            Choosing a first home is important but so is thinking about your second. Choosing the financing for that first purchase goes hand in hand. If you plan to live in the home for 5-7 years, it might not be wise to get a 30-year mortgage. Equally, if you’re buying a fixer-upper and know once the renovations are completed the value will go up, you might be okay with putting 3-5 percent down on a house, paying PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance), and refinancing out of it once the value changes.

                            As a first-time homebuyer, you might also qualify for an FHA loan (a government-backed mortgage that requires lower credit scores and down payments than many conventional loans) but these come with upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums, that will affect your payment.

                        We see great value in advising our buyers every step of the way, especially those who have never owned a home before. For them, the process can be fraught and stressful, but it doesn’t need to be. Ultimately, we like to think of it as an opportunity to help our clients make the best and most informed decision they can during one of the most pivotal moments in their lives.
